    <h2>Documentation</h2>
    <br>
    <p>Documentation is made so it can simplify your learning and make it easy.
    <br>We are making the documentation as it will not also make the users happier
    <br>but it will make a huge difference to the people that are using SophusGUI.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>First, you have to create a python file any name, I called it main.py . After,
    <br>just type import SophusGUI . Follow thee tutorial to make other code under here.
    <br>Now to create a gui app write create_gui_app() . Click Run and then you will
    <br>have a 900x500, lightgray background GUI application. If you want a button
    <br>just type gui_button() . There are a lot of buttons to see but you have to 
    <br>view it in the code file. To make a different background colour just type
    <br>guiBg_Red() to make the red background colour and there also many different
    <br>background colours just view them in the code file. There are many built-in
    <br>titles like Application, SophusGUI and many to make them type this :
    <br>guiTitle_SophusGUI() or guiTitle_Application() and there many in the code
    <br>file. Next you have the CheckBoxes or RadioButtons to make them type this:
    <br>guiCheckBox_Countries and again there are many samples of these.
    <br>Thank you and so far we've only got so far to this on coding SophusGUI.
